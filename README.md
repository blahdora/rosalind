# Rosalind 
Welcome to the Rosalind Solutions repository! 

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. This project aims to provide clear, well-documented solutions to the problems on Rosalind. 

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shalinis602/rosalind.git
    cd rosalind
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Alternatively, you can use conda environment.

1. Install Miniconda or Anaconda.

2. Create and activate the conda environment.
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate <environment_name>
    ```

Now your Rosalind project is set up with a virtual environment, ensuring a consistent and conflict-free development environment. You can download the relevant datasets from Rosalind and run the python scripts.
