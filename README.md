# Rosalind 
Welcome to the Rosalind Solutions and Explanations repository! Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. This project aims to provide clear, well-documented solutions to the problems on the Rosalind platform. 

## Solutions
Each problem is located in its respective directory, with the following structure:

```
|-- problem_id/
    |-- problem_id.py  
    |-- rosalind_problem_id.txt
    |-- problem_id.md
```

- **problem_id.py:** The code that solves the problem.
- **rosalind_problem_id.txt:** The sample dataset.
- **problem_id.md:** Link to the problem, problem statement followed by a detailed explanation of the solution.
