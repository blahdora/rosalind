### **Description:**

**Given:** A string 𝑠 of length at most 200 letters and four integers 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 and 𝑑.

**Return:** The slice of this string from indices 𝑎 through 𝑏 and 𝑐 through 𝑑 (with space in between), *inclusively*. In other words, we should include elements 𝑠[𝑏] and 𝑠[𝑑] in our slice.

### **Explanation:**

It's a straightforward string manipulation problem using string stripping and slicing. The script reads an input string and four indices from a file. It then extracts two substrings from the input string using these indices and prints the result.
